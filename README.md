# Elden Skills Registry

This repository hosts Elden skills in two scopes:

- `official/`: Officially maintained skills
- `community/`: Community-contributed skills

## Layout

Skills are stored under:

- `official/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
- `community/<category>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

Optional extra files are allowed, for example:

- `references/` for docs
- `templates/` for templates
- `scripts/` for helper scripts

## Index

`components.json` is the canonical registry index used by Elden CLI check/update flows.
